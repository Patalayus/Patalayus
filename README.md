Hi. I'm Luke, a computer scientist with an avid interest in programming and mathematics.
I enjoy a good challenge when it comes to solo or team projects and like helping others around me with the same goal in mind. I have worked on many team-based projects in the past as well as personal ones! Some of them are listed below, and more can be found on my website.  
 - Calculator Application
 - Personal Project
